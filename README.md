## Getting Started

The following assumes you've already successfully installed Inductive Ignition with the perspective module. If you need more information on how to do that, visit [Inductive University](https://inductiveuniversity.com). It also assumes you have a basic understanding of git and that you have a working git client.

Navigate to the your ignition projects directory. On linux that's typically:

`/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/projects`

and on windows:

`c:\Program Files\Inductive Automation\Ignition\data\projects`

and clone this repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/joyja/ignition-framework.git {project_name}`

where `{project_name}` is the name you'd like your framework project to have.

Then restart your Ignition Gateway and the project will be registered by Ignition.
